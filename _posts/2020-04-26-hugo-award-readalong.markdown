## Hugo Award Readalong 2020


Last year I went to Worldcon for the first time. It was so much fun and with the convention membership came voting rights to the Hugo Awards.
I had so much fun reading through the nominations and discovered loads of great stories. The highlight for me was discovering that I like graphic
novels and reading Saga which is now one of my all time favourite things.

This year I've decided to read for the Hugos again but I've set a less ambitious target for which categories I will read. I got really burnt out trying to read EVERYTHING last year
before the voting deadline and it just took out some of the fun and made reading a chore. I ended up in a massive slump and I don't want to recreate that.
I'm hoping to read all of the nominees for Best Novel, Best Novella, Best Graphic Novel and Best Short Story, I've already read a fair chunk of these last year so hopefully I'll get through them.

But reading is more fun when you can discuss the books so I've made a schedule for a readalong of the Best Novel category, which just has such an incredible line up.
The ones I've read already are all so good, I don't know how I will pick a favourite. The schedule is designed so we can discuss them all before the award is announced, if you're voting you
might need to read them a bit quicker as I'm not sure when the voting deadline is!

It's going to be fairly low key, no requirement to join for all of them, or even to read the book if you've already done so and just want to chat. I know post is terrible right now, so if you can't
get all the books you want I hope you can still join in with some of it and I'll happily still discuss the books long after the readalong. The plan is group chats for each book that can be
spoilery from the discussion date and an instagram hashtag #hugoawardreadalong2020 so I can stalk what people think about the books! If you want to join in with any of the groups chats let me know,
otherwise just use the hashtag to get involved.
