Twitter blew up in outrage earlier this week over the terrible diversity campaign by Barnes and Noble. I can't get it out of my head.
I know publishing still has a way to go with representing diverse views but I definitely thought we were past a time when people
stick a bunch of coloured faces on predominately white books (that in some cases were outright racist) and think that's a way to promote diversity.
I decided to write a post celebrating books I love and books I am excited to read by authors of colour in SFF. It's not an exhaustive list and if anyone has
some recommendations please send them my way.


## Epic Fantasy Worlds

# Spotlight: Empire Of Sand & Realm of Ash by Tasha Suri

I love these two books. They are set in a Mughal inspired fantasy world and each follow one of two sisters.
The first follows Mehr and how she is treated for using magic that is forbidden, through her we get to see more of the world,
explore the wonderful dance magic and learn just why people who use it are hunted down. The second is set years later,
following Mehr's little sister Arwa, who has been widowed at a young age and is full of rage. She throws herself into a dangerous
situation in the hope that she can help to save the crumbling empire. Both books are full of anger, strength, hope and slow burn romances.

# Books I enjoyed:

* Sword of Kaigen by M L Wang - Japanese inspired fantasy with cool magic and epic sword fights.
* The Tensorate novellas by J Y Yang - Epic world with crazy politics, magic, dragons, dinosaurs and a really interesting exploration of gender identity.
* The Poppy War by R F Kuang - A dark and brutal story inspired by the Sino-Japanese war. I couldn't put it down.
* Monstress by Marjorie Liu and Sana Takeda - A dark fantasy graphic novel in a art deco, steampunk, Asian inspired world. The art in this is STUNNING!

# Books I'm excited to read:
* Jade City by Fonda Lee - Described to me as Godfather with magic and kungfu.
* The Grace of Kings by Ken Liu - Described to me as wonderful, silkpunk epic fantasy.

## Post Apocalyptic Stories

# Spotlight: The Broken Earth trilogy by N K Jemisin
The Fifth Season blew my mind and the rest of the series continued at a supremely high standard. It's set in a world where apocalypses are
so frequent that they are referred to as a "season". There are people with a power that can cause or stop earthquake and they are feared and hunted.
Parts of the books are in the second person which I found disorientating at first but it ends up working really well. My favourite thing about this
series is that I was always in a constant state of confusion with just enough revealed to keep me hooked and the payoff was so worth it.

# Books I enjoyed:
* Trail of Lightning by Rebecca Roanhorse - A post apocalyptic monster hunting book set on a Navajo reservation.
* Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler - Climate change apocalypse, girl who feels the pain of others discovers a new religion.
* Who Fears Death by Nnedi Okarafor - Post nuclear apocalypse Africa, girl learns magic in order to stop the genocide of her people.
