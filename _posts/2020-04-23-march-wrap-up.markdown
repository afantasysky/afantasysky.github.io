![March In Summary](/assets/march.jpg)

## My Month

March was weird and the world went crazy so this is really late but I want it to refer back to. A Memory Called Empire was incredible, such intricate world building and a great story and characters.
I also finally finished Kushiel's Dart which took me about a month, but after a SLOW start I really got engrossed and ended up loving it.

Only one short story this month but it has cemented Rivers Solomon as a must read author for me, I love their writing and how it brings across different perspectives.
