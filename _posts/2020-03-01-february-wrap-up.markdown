## My Month

February was a month of short reads for me, I managed to finish 10 books but read about 1000 less pages than I did last month! I took part in the Tamora Pierce 
readalong and I really enjoyed rereading all of the Alanna books, my opinion has changed quite drastically on some parts. In the Hand of the
Goddess used to be my favourite of the quartet and this reread it was probably the one I enjoyed least. The Woman Who Rides Like a Man was probably 
the one I enjoyed the most this time around. 

The London Bookshop crawl was this month and I went on a buying spree so I didn't manage to read more unread books than I bought this month but hopefully I can 
catch up next month. I love getting the opportunity to explore new bookshops and it was fun being an official guide this year. 

I only read three short stories this month but my favourite was probably Circus Girl, The Hunter and Mirror Boy by JY Neon Yang. It was a really interesting 
twist on being haunted and I think it explored dealing with past trauma really well.
