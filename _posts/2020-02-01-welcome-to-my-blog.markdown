I'm Gagan, a software engineer who is obsessed with reading science fiction and fantasy books.

I'm going to try and post wrap ups of what I've read each month and anything else I feel like!

This is mainly for myself but if you're interested and want to chat about anything I post you can find me on Instagram.
